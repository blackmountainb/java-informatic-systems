Repository for multiple assignments for object oriented programming (OOPs), RMI and Sockets programming in Java, for Informatic Systems' course

This work was developed as a project for final evaluation of Informatic Systems course for Biomedical Engineering Master Degree at University of Coimbra.

Authors: Beatriz Negromonte (negromontebs@gmail.com) and Rafael Molter (rafaelmolter@gmail.com)

## Goal:
For evaluation of the course, we had 4 different assignments:

    1 - [Hanoi Tower](https://github.com/blackmountainb/java-informatic-systems/blob/main/Hanoi%20Tower.java)

    The goal was to create a Hanoi tower game without using OOPs, just to learn Java language and exercise it.

    2 - [OOP Game](https://github.com/blackmountainb/java-informatic-systems/blob/main/OOP%20Game)

    The goal was to create Domino game as object oriented programming (OOP). The folder contains 4 objects, Domino, Jogador (Player), Partida (round) and Main, where the game happens.

    3 - [Sockets](https://github.com/blackmountainb/java-informatic-systems/blob/main/Sockets)

    The goal was to develop a cliente-server communication, where user will create a login and play Hanoi Tower game with the server. 

    4 - [RMI](https://github.com/blackmountainb/java-informatic-systems/blob/main/RMI)

    The goal was to develop a RMI with cliente-server communication and manage a database of a library. The server containes objects author, library and publication information.
